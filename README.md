I knew I wanted to revise my Visual Argument because while it was what I was envisioning, it didn't look aesthetically pleasing. It was too straight forward in getting the message across. In my revision, I sort of combined my previous one in an artistic way. I made the full highway dark and gloomy and chose one car to look bright. Obviously, this car was supposed to represent electric vehicles and the others gas vehicles. I also like how simple, yet effective the text I chose is. In my first draft I wrote "electric vehicles vs. gas vehicles" and in my revised version I wrote "DRIVE ELECTRIC." The first text was too straighforward and obvious, while the revision text leaves the audience some freedom to think. 
The three screenshots I included showed my process of creating my new revision. The first screenshot shows the highway with a light gray box I put over it. Then, I layered images of clouds and rain over the entire image. Next, I singled out one of the white cars to show an "electric vehicle" by erasing the background of the original highway image. Finally, I put a yellow light halo image behind that and added the text.
