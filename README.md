I knew I wanted to revise my Visual Argument because while it was what I was envisioning, it didn't look aesthetically pleasing. It was too straight forward in getting the message across. In my revision, I sort of combined my previous one in an artistic way. I made the full highway dark and gloomy and chose one car to look bright. Obviously, this car was supposed to represent electric vehicles and the others gas vehicles. I also like how simple, yet effective the text I chose is. In my first draft I wrote "electric vehicles vs. gas vehicles" and in my revised version I wrote "DRIVE ELECTRIC." The first text was too straighforward and obvious, while the revision text leaves the audience some freedom to think.
